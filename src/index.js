// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals



//CHALLENGE: Make the code in App.jsx work.
//The final app should have a single contact
//with fName, lName and email.

//HINT: You'll need to apply the following things you learnt:
//1. Using JS Objects with state.
//2. Making use of previous state when changing state.
//3. Working with forms in React.
//4. Handing events
